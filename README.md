## Learning Journal
### React
* Component -  An individual item that can obtain other items. It serves as a container or logic to get data, other components for specific functionality etc. 
* Props - Similar to an HTML attribute. It allows any data type to be passed as long as JavaScript support it. 
  * Context is used to pass data through many levels
* State - A place where component data is saved. Each component can have a state.
* JSX - Allows XML like code to be written by combining HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
  * Separation of the concerns can be achieved by separating the HTML, CSS and JavaScript code into different files. 
* Lifecycle - Every components goes through certain cycles and all those separate stages can be accesd by using React lifecycle methods.
